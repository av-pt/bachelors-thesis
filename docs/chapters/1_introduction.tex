\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}
% Introduction / The Problem / My Idea?
Idea: Using phonetic features for Authorship Verification could be useful.
Why? -> Assumption: authors produce different texts based on their phonetic preferences (explain reasoning, course p277)
Contributions:\\
- Unite authorship identification methods with phonetic methods (non-refutable)
- investigate the effect of using phonetic features for authorship identificaiton
% Example -> One that hints at phonetic features being useful.

We show that there is no effect.
Why? -> Either thesis is wrong or an error somewhere else (e.g. phonetic preferences too diverse, etc. look at big open questions / roadblocks)
