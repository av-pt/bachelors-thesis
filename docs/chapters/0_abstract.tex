Authorship Verification is an important task in the field of stylometry.
We hypothesize that an author has a certain phonetic preference which leads them to unconsciously imprint (latent) features into written text.
Using a range of phonetic transcription systems in conjunction with two well-known Authorship Verification algorithms, we examine the use (Nutzen) of extracting phonetically relevant features (for AV).
We find that the benefits of using these transcription systems is insignificant.
We point out that there are two major problems in this approach which need further investigation.
For reproducibility, all code is published as open-source.
