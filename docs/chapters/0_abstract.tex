Authorship Verification is the task of deciding whether two given texts were written by the same author or by different authors.
We hypothesize that authors have a \textit{phonetic preference}, based on which they produce different texts, and that we can use this phonetic information to aid in classification.
Using a range of phonetic transcription systems of different granularity, we examine the viability of transcribing textual data prior to using it in two well-known Authorship Verification algorithms.
We find that the use of phonetic transcription systems does not yield an improvement in performance.
In fact, for many configurations we record statistically significant decreases in performance.
We propose three possible explanations for the negative results.
For reproducibility, all code is published as open-source.
