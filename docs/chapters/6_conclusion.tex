\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
% Short summary

Care has been taken to make all research easily reproducible and understandable (source-code READMES etc.).

% Discussion
% Initially suspected no improvement with transcription approaches. Probably too much information is lost in transcribing.
% Where to put this?

Problems:\\
-

Outlook:\\
- Improve usability of unmasking, cite DH paper (Juola 2007), got a request for use of unmasking
- Use large PAN20 dataset on better hardware.
- Closer inspection of possible correlation: vocab size ~ evaluation results
- Down-sample transcriptions so that vocab size is the same.
