TBD: Summary, conclusion, outlook
}

%Care has been taken to make all research easily reproducible and understandable (source-code READMES etc.).

% Discussion
% Initially suspected no improvement with transcription approaches. Probably too much information is lost in transcribing.
% Where to put this?


%Outlook:\\
%- Improve usability of unmasking, cite DH paper (Juola 2007), got a request for use of unmasking
%- Use large PAN20 dataset on better hardware.
%- Closer inspection of possible correlation: vocab size ~ evaluation results
%- Down-sample transcriptions so that vocab size is the same.
